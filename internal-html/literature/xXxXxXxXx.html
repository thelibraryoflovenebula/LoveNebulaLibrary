	<h1>xXxXxXxXx</h1>

	<p>
		Seasons, rising and blending to make one, the human-less earth sits still with the life source of God’s creations, dying and living, dying and living, swimming in the current of the cycle of life. One morning, the rising sun aligns to the centre of the universe, a being, a ray of light, arriving near it like a blazing asteroid. There once it arrives around the flares of the ball, it uses its eyes to stare at the sun. Directly, at the sun, for 7 billion years, channeling as much energy as it can to charge him for the next trillions of years. There, the works of the bible commence and fast-forwarded right before the second coming of one anointed as Christ. As a prophesied worker of the throne, stepping into the plane of time that is frozen in his dimension, xXxXxXx is born unto earth. From there, and on his birth, his tribulations fore-coming unto him shape him into the toughened warrior to fight along side the war of Satan’s final downfall, on the side of Jesus Christ, anointed and prophesied by the hand that Is. Though not as cleanly as the aforementioned Yeshua, willing is the spirit that oh so wants to fight alongside the light army. <br><br>
		
		
And so he shall. Training days and training days he shall get there. To live out the blank and empty headed days or the life crushing anvils that fall sharp headed first into both his eyes, and the tall grand days of joyous livings and warming dwellings of the world around him: he shall use this flesh opportunity to mark his own role into the battle. <br><br>

With the horns he shall weave and wand out the lonely dwellers of the dark and uplift them out of their caves, unblind their spirits and bind them into one with the soul of the ultimate sacrifice. With the solar choirs that sparkle novas in the drums of the people’s ears, brightening their shoulders and letting go of their weight. xXxXxXx shall be his name, and xXxXxXx shall be glorious. He shall also create a window to the basement of the universe, one that is absent of the needed light to live forever, and scare the young off out of uncleanly hands. This window shall be the most transparent ever to be crafted, and the glass made of the clearest metal that may appear invisible, but make no mistake, his artistry and craftsmanship will allow him to make it out of the most strongest material known in the universe. And through his tribulations, journeys, downfalls and learnings he shall find the tools necessary to gather these material, learn from the history of makers to master the skills needed. <br><br>

He will guide nations into the gates, but make no mistake, for the Good Shepard is the one and only, capable of leading the sheep into the palace, as in being the one standing of judgment. <br><br>

With fire, xXxXxXx will receive the gifts needed to be apart of the war, but know that he will be judged twice as hard as the average. He shall bear his own consequence and own manner as well, and it shall tear him apart, but also bind him closer to the one true god. With fire, he will wield it and scorch it unto the staffs of sheet music. With fire he will bend it to his spirits desire and hold it dearly, letting it burn him to show the light unto dark dwellers. Yes it may burn him, but that is the responsibility and consequence of being a wielder of such caliber. <br><br>

But there, as his horns, choirs, violins, pianos shine straight into the heart of Lucifer, stabbing it straight through faster than the speed of light, with the force of ten billion elephants, scorching its flesh a blaze and the gloss of god’s army to celebrate its triumph, as they ride into the door of infinity. <br><br>
