	<h1>Solstice</h1>

	<p>
		The rustling of the leaves clutter the path as Ezrael hikes along the trail. Crumbling as they are stepped on by a lost man’s feet, hummingbirds watching as he wanders around the forest. White sparkles glitter behind the patches of a bush, and as he walked up closer the rushing water became more audible. He peeked over the bush and saw a clear spring river, and along from whence the river followed from was a small waterfall the size of Ezrael. A family of deers came and drank from the pools, squirrels and birds nested in unison on the branches of the trees. The forest made it so there was a circle ceiling of sky atop the height of the trees, and the shine of the sun glistened over this corner of the alpine river as eagles calling as they eclipsed in front of the sun. Resting weary of wandering, Ezrael held open his wrinkled palms and drank from the pools, the animals drank with him, unstartled and welcoming. Then, he heard an owl whistle directly from the waterfall. As he peered over at the rocky waterfall to the noise, a reflection emerged from the rushing water. He could only make out a shape of white circle, so he then pulled his face closer to look. <br> <br> 
			
As he did so, he felt the door to his heart flung struck open, as the shadow of the circle turned into a wheel inside a wheel, each rotating in all 4 directions and eyes upon the rims. The sound of the rushing water grew louder and louder, as if the sound was coming from inside his ears, and the singing of the birds blemished into repeating echoes dropped into a bottomless cavern, and as it echoed back to him it sounded like trillions of elephants trumpets like a roaring thunder. But from the cavern, he heard a white arrow sling outwards from the bottom, a beam of light splitting the darkness in two as the ray flew upwards faster than the sound of echoes. As the arrow approached the centre of the wheels, the edges bent itself into a concave shape to fit the tip of the bow, like the edges of a mushroom cloud. There, the light ray slowed itself before the wheel, reaching it as if it were a feather dropping. And when it connected, a burst of violet fire flared wide. Lavender streaks expanded outwards from the wheel, reaching itself farther and farther out into the void, as the wheel collapsed into itself and into a dot of light. The sound was loud, but the blast was so far away that it took 9 seconds for it to reach Ezrael, and when it reached him he heard as if two swords clashed strongly against each other and that his ears were inside the clash. <br> <br> 
			
But he didn’t hear the sound, he was the sound. And as violet spread more and more outwards, he started to understood why he himself breathed and why the deers and birds drank water, why the eagles soared across the sun and why the night fell after. An ocean of light purple started to emerge, as his eye at the top of the pink sky reflected on the surface of the sea, glittering and shining from every angle upon this vast and endless world. And as the lilac flames started to reach onto every crevice of the dark bird-sung cavern, he felt a hand reach upon him. A hand with wooly softness came to greet him, and he felt its might as if it were the hand that propped it, cradling it in its palms. It greeted him, he smiled, and opened his hand for him. It lifted Ezrael upwards and he felt a scorching beauty beheld before him. Glory enclosed all around him, as purple sapphire choirs sung before gleaming wings. 7 angels enclosed in a perfect circle around the heart of the hand that greeted him. There, the angels had wings of pure gold, as pure as glass, and had shape of eyebrows. Each head of the angel had three crystallized flowers sprung out from its head, each had 1 eye that looked like an open mouth that sung a note. Each note the angels sang were of different notes, yet were all in perfect harmony with perfectly intonation, a sung chord that perfectly painted the divinity before him. And thus before him, as the ultraviolet music that engulfed him reached its peak, and the pool of brightness glowed its brightest, the hand before him spoke in a Byzantine rhythm, a language he could not speak but perfectly understood. Every beat he heard was eternal in nature, and it was as if it had melodies woven into itself, and every motif was a shape and colour that never existed, yet it has always existed, until now. He saw images form, shapes emerge and reshape as if it were breathing, and colour he could not see before yet he is seeing now. He saw, and it was full of glory. <br> <br> 
			
As the psalm reached a decrescendo, the hand that lifted him began to draw Ezrael downwards, there as he descended he saw a valley of bones trail downwards and downwards and downwards, walls of skulls buried and piled over piles of gushing blood clots. Like a never ending elevator, Ezrael’s heart started racing and his breath was losing as if he was underwater. As he furthered downwards he saw magma eyes scattered below, each eye open and full of screeching firing, and walls that screamed and banged mercilessly on cages that slowly turned to blazing metal. Flesh and flesh everywhere, and eye-speared swords tossing and swirling at every soul imaginable. Then, a sword coming at lightning speed, hurled at Ezrael. He braced for impact, but the palm that held him stopped it. He saw the sword stop, but a pierced hand that held it. <br> <br> 
			
Suddenly, the two were lifted back up into darkness and nothingness with no sound, and Ezrael saw a rainbow oozing from the hand’s wound. The sword was pulled out and left a hole in the hand, and there Ezrael saw the hand patch itself up with new flesh and new bone, just the same as it was before. But drops of blood still trickled to the bottoms of the palm, and Ezrael was asked to drink the blood. There, Ezrael closed his eye and drank from the blood. It was celestial glory, he felt every fibre of his being replenished from a single sip, and refreshed was his eyes and ears and soul. It was so heavenly he started hearing spring water rushing under a sunlit forest. Ezraella opened his eyes and there he was, hands palmed open full the spring water, next to the squirrels and birds and the family of deer. The surface of his mouth was covered in water, and Ezraella looked up unto the open forest ceiling where the sun was at the tip top centre. He smiled at the sun, and he heard an eagle cry out in the distance. He petted the deer and went along his way, wandering back into the wilderness, back into the oneness of god’s image. <br> <br>
